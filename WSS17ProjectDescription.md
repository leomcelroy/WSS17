Project Description

I am going to search for interesting variations in the classic Bak-Tang-Weisenfeld sandpile model by searching through rulesets of 2D cellular automata (CA). Interesting results include discovery additional rules that result in self-organized criticality and distinctive finding non-physical models. I plan to constrain the search with heuristics like sand conservation and observable power law collapses. I will also search for distinctive topographies and outer boundaries. I will then create and print a 3D model of the sandpile which will describe the evolution of a 2D CA over time.

Plan
* Understand Stephen Wolfram's programs in NKS.
* Generalize 2D CA sandpile programs.
* Set up experiment.
* Run search for interesting programs.
* 3D print interesting sandpiles.
